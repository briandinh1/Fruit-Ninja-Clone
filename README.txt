Fruit slicing game inspired by Fruit Ninja. Made Made in Unity with C#
EXE file is in the respective folder, as well as an APK for Android. The UI is a little wonky in Android though. gotta work on my UI skills

It's set in the 3D environment but with a fixed camera to simulate 2D. Only the spheres (representing fruits) are 3D for some nice depth and lighting effects.
Implemented object pooling to increase efficiency and performance, so the game doesn't have to instantiate tons of fruits

Game spawns random fruits at 7 different spawn locations. The spawn delay gets faster and faster every 15 fruits cut down. 
Bombs end the game. They spawn in at 5% chance to start with and slowly cap out to 50%.
There is also a powerup that can give double points for 5 seconds.
